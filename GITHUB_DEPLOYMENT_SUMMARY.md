## 📋 Next Steps for CEO Testing

### 1. GitHub Upload
- Upload the entire project to https://github.com/panosbee/ddc
- Verify .gitignore excludes sensitive files
- Confirm all documentation is accessible

### 2. Environment File Preparation
- Create production .env file with real API keys
- Test the .env file with actual credentials
- Prepare secure delivery method for CEO

### 3. CEO Laptop Preparation
- Confirm MongoDB is installed and running
- Verify Python 3.8+ and Node.js 16+ are available
- Test Windows compatibility

### 4. Testing Process
1. CEO downloads project from GitHub
2. CEO receives .env file separately
3. CEO runs: install.bat
4. CEO runs: run.bat
5. CEO tests system with admin/admin123

## 🎉 Success Criteria
