# Diabetes Center

This repository contains the source code for the diabetes management platform. It includes multiple subprojects such as the backend API, frontend applications and patient portal.

## Running the Test Suite

Unit tests live in the `tests/` directory and use `pytest`.
To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that the Python dependencies are installed (see `diabetes_backend/requirements.txt`).
