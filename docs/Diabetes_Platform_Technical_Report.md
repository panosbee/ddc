## 4. Security Protocols

### 4.1 Data Protection Measures
| Control | Implementation | Compliance |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Encryption at Rest | AES-256 | HIPAA §164.312(a)(2)(iv) |
| Encryption in Transit | TLS 1.3 | NIST SP 800-52 |
| Access Control | RBAC with JWT | HIPAA §164.312(a)(1) |
| Audit Logging | Immutable records | GDPR Article 30 |
| File Security | Per-patient access, signed URLs | Custom |
| WebRTC Security | Encrypted peer-to-peer | Custom |
| OCR Data Handling | In-memory, never stored | Custom |

### 4.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: All API endpoints (except login) require JWT tokens. Tokens are short-lived and securely stored.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Doctors can only access their own patients and sessions. Common space patients require explicit permissions.
- **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed with bcrypt and never stored in plaintext.
- **Session & File Permissions**: Fine-grained controls ensure only authorized users can view, edit, or delete sensitive data.

### 4.3 Compliance & Auditing
- **HIPAA & GDPR**: All data flows, storage, and access patterns are designed for compliance with major medical data regulations.
- **Audit Trails**: Every access, edit, and file exchange is logged immutably for full traceability.
